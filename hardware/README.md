# Hardware & Install BOM Cheat Sheet

Welcome to the parts buffet that keeps Perceptual Drift airborne without sacrificing safety cred. This BOM leans on components you can actually source, with specs noted so you can swap equivalents without breaking the vibe. Prices swing, so think in ranges and order spares.

> **Reading tip**: The tables are organized by subsystem. `Qty` means how many you need for a single playable bay (1 drone, 1 projection). Scale linearly for multi-bay builds, or bring a spreadsheet and a stiff coffee.

## Sourcing & Logistics Notes

- **Batch ordering**: For multi-drone fleets, buy duct sets, props, and LiPos in bulk directly from Gemfan and GNB. Customs lead time can hit 4–6 weeks.
- **Documentation binder**: Print the safety checklist, assumption ledger, and this BOM; stash in a waterproof pouch at the operator console.
- **Flight batteries**: Store at 3.8 V per cell; airlines will ask for fireproof LiPo bags ([Bat-Safe Mini](https://batsafe.com/bat-safe-mini/)).
- **Spare drone**: Budget a full ready-to-fly spare per bay. Nothing kills the vibe faster than cannibalizing frames mid-show.

For wiring and cage build specifics, hop into [`flight_cage/`](flight_cage) and [`leds/`](leds). Add your own war stories via pull request — the more field notes, the better.
