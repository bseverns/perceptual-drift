# ASSUMPTION LEDGER

- **A1: Indoor micro‑FPV** will remain safer than 5″ quads in galleries.  
  - *Mitigation*: netted cage, prop guards, angle mode, low throttle cap.
- **A2: Participants want agency without piloting**.  
  - *Mitigation*: group aggregation → probabilistic mapping.
- **A3: Minimal PII** (no face storage) is sufficient for interaction fidelity.  
  - *Mitigation*: silhouette/optical‑flow only, no cloud.
- **A4: Analog FPV is acceptable** for latency; HD can be added later.  
  - *Mitigation*: VRX + low‑latency capture; delay used as aesthetic element.
