# Spectator script (crib sheet)

One-page patter for the pre-show talk. Read it straight or riff; the goal is to make consent and play cues impossible to miss.

---

**Hi, you’re about to steer the drone.**

- **What you’re seeing:** The projection shows your silhouettes, not faces. Amber = observing only. Cyan = live control. If you want to spectate only, hang back in the amber zone.
- **Safety line:** Stay inside the taped pads; props never cross the net. If anything feels off, step backward and raise a hand — I’ll pause instantly.
- **How to move it:**
  - Lateral sways → drift left/right.
  - Tall/short poses → altitude up/down.
  - Whole-crowd wiggle → brighter LEDs and audio.
  - The rig never records audio or faces; it responds to motion blobs only.
- **Consent switch:** I’m gating the system. While the bar is amber, nothing is armed and MSP outputs stay neutral. When you’re ready, I’ll flip to cyan and you’ll feel the lag (target <300 ms). Say “pause” or step out at any time and we freeze back to amber.
- **Opt-out & deletion:** If you want out, step off the pads and I’ll idle the stream. If you want today’s traces purged, tell me — I’ll run the buffer wipe and log it before you leave.
- **What could go wrong:**
  - *Camera hiccups?* You’ll see the projection fade; I’ll reboot the tracker and keep props idle.
  - *Drone taps the net?* I kill throttle, announce the pause, and swap the battery/prop before resuming.
  - *You’re overwhelmed?* Step out. The LEDs will guide you; there’s water and a bench by the exit.
- **Wrap-up:** After a couple minutes we cool down, archive the run log locally, and share a stats vignette. Nothing leaves the room without your explicit ok.

Keep it conversational, keep it human, and remind folks the amber/cyan code is for them, not us.
