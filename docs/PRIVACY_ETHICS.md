# PRIVACY & ETHICS

- **Consent‑forward**: A visible on‑screen state shows when the system is idle vs engaged.
- **Data minimization**: No persistent storage of identifiable frames. No cloud calls.
- **Erase‑now**: Hotkey to purge buffers immediately.
- **Disclosure**: Label the installation with a plain‑language tech + ethics card.
- **Telemetry**: Drone telemetry is local‑only; no public broadcast of control data.
