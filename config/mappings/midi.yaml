# MIDI mapping file for routing drift metrics to Control Change messages.
# DAW template: Live/Bitwig racks with the first macro bank pinned to CC20–27.
# Knob 1/2 ride the motion centroid (lat/alt), knob 3 is entropy/energy, knob 4
# is the consent gate, knob 5 mirrors population inside the consent zone. The
# remaining CCs stay open for scene-specific macros.
