# MIDI mapping for shaping gesture input alongside OSC.
# Channel numbers are 1-indexed to match most DAWs and controller silkscreens.
input:
  channel: 1
  port_name: "perceptual-drift-midi"

# Each gesture entry binds a CC or Note to one of the mapper's axes.
# ``response`` controls how values are normalized:
#   * ``bipolar``  → 0..127 maps to -1..1 (good for stick-like axes)
#   * ``unipolar`` → 0..127 maps to 0..1 (great for intensity layers)
# Notes default to gates: velocity > 0 sets 1, note off sets 0.
