name: "Soft Consent Lounge"
slug: soft-consent-lounge
description: |
  Diffuse wash. The drone drifts only when the room agrees, then glides like it
  knows the floor is lava. Keeps throttle shy, yaw bias soft, and LEDs pulsing a
  low-contrast aurora. Built for opening the space slowly while facilitators
  narrate the consent protocol.
intent: "gentle onboarding, keep props quiet until the crowd breathes together"

  notes: |
    Fade the entire strip through the palette over ~18 seconds. If you are using
    Teensy firmware, set the LFO depth low so the palette barely kisses white.

  story: |
    Soft-focus mirror. Minimal latency, gentle saturation dip, subtle blue lift
    to match the LED aura.
  obs_scene: "FPV + Telemetry — ambient_soften"
  obs_overlay_notes: |
    Build the OBS scene with the ambient_soften chain plus the telemetry Text
    source pointing at runtime/obs_overlay/telemetry_overlay.txt (white text,
    drop shadow on). Scene name above is the one to export.
