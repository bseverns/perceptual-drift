  Lights down, breath up. The drone hovers like a censer, easing altitude and
  lateral moves so the crowd can focus on slow collective gestures. Video turns
  velvety with infrared vibes and LEDs pulse like a distant lighthouse.

    Slow sine fade across the palette with AUX2 controlling phase speed.
    Keep peak intensity under 160 to prevent accidental wake-up flashes.

    Lean into noir. Use the infrared-style preset so the audience watches a
    ghost of themselves sway without jitter.
